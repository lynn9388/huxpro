# HuxPro

![Screenshot](screenshot.png)

HuxPro is a clean and refined Jekyll theme, and it's easy to be used as a [remote theme](https://github.blog/2017-11-29-use-any-theme-with-github-pages/).

GitHub Pages' remote theme is kind like a [gem-based theme](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#understanding-gem-based-themes). The user doesn't need to worry about the theme files (like HTML, CSS, etc.), but focus on the posts. When the theme is separated with your content, it's easier to deployed and update your site.

> With gem-based themes, some of the site’s directories (such as the `assets`, `_layouts` and `_includes` directories) are stored in the theme’s gem, hidden from your immediate view. Yet all the necessary directories will be read and processed during Jekyll’s build process.
